#Grids
Stipe's grid solution for Toadstool aims to make the application of responsive/adaptive grids as simple as possible. 

###Stability note
Stipe grid solution currently supports the common use of 12 column grids. While there is some code in the Grid solution for 16 col grids, there have been changes that break this functionality.
